## 📘 Project Overview

Marketing analytics helps organizations understand which campaigns drive engagement, conversions, and ROI.  
In this project, we use a dataset of marketing campaign performance metrics to:
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**
- Visualize relationships between campaign variables
- Extract actionable insights about customer segments, channels, and campaign effectiveness

The dataset used:
🔗 [marketing_campaign.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArchanaInsights/Datasets/main/marketing_campaign.csv)

## 🧩 Key Steps

### 1. Data Loading & Preparation
- Loaded dataset using `pandas`
- Inspected structure, data types, and summary statistics
- Reviewed unique values across campaign categories (e.g., `Campaign_Type`, `Channel_Used`, `Customer_Segment`)

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
#### Campaign Performance
- Relationship between **Acquisition Cost** and **ROI**
- Comparison of **Conversion Rate** across marketing channels and campaign types
- Distribution of **Engagement Score** among campaign types
- ROI comparison across companies

#### Customer Segmentation
- Analysis of target audience distribution
- Conversion Rate comparison by **Customer Segment** and **Language**
- Acquisition Cost variation across **Customer Segments** and **Channels Used**

### 3. Visualization
- Used `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizations:
  - Scatter plots
  - Bar charts
  - Box plots
  - Heatmaps for correlation analysis
